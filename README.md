nixplorer is a TUI browser for Nix derivations.

Note: This software is pretty much unmaintained, I only hack on it occasionally.

### Usage

    nixplorer /nix/store/something.drv

### Keybindings

Note: These are not final.

    up, down        select derivation input
    home            select the first derivation input
    end             select the last derivation input
    right, enter    view selected derivation
    left            view parent derivation
    y               copy the selected path
    page up/down    scroll the environment window
